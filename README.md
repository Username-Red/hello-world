# Overview

It's a pretty simple program, I suppose the main thing  was trying to accomplish with this one was to make the basic "Hello, World!" program more fun and interesting. 

This piece of software's main goal is to generate "Wello, World!" in the middle of the computer screen and have it dance a bit.

The purpose for this program is to fulfill course requirements.
